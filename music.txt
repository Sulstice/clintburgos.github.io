I've gone through a wide range of sound since 2009, starting several solo projects and collaborative efforts. I currently use Ableton Live to create my music, and also write acoustic songs on a portable 4-track.

<b>Noizybrain</b>

This is my most recent music. Noize From A Dark Room is a noisy-but-smoothing set of songs (somewhat of the shoegaze ethos). You Can Never Go Home was written and recorded while backpacking around Europe and pretty accurately preserves my thoughts from the time. I've also posted a few electronic tracks on SoundCloud.

<b>Wave One</b> 

An old studio project with David Estes-Smargiassi. We recorded our first album as Wave One in span of about two weeks, then took a year to edit and refine the songs, covering several sonic influences and focusing on the theme of dark psychedelic nostalgia. The favorite from that album was <i>Downtown Club</i>, a dark at atmosphereic beat-driven tune. We also wrote a few non-album singles, the best of which was <i>Invitation</i>. We were asked if our song <i>History in the Making</i> could be used in the documentary Sky High, so we revamped it with higher audio quality and some re-recordings for them.

<b>Outdoor Window</b>

This was my first musical work. It comes out of time when I had not heard that much music, and had little knowledge in classifying it (and so little cynacism in writing it). The result can be pretty weird, and somewhat charming. <i>A Faint Ring</i> definitely signals a transition into my 4-track acoustic stuff as Noizybrain. It was influenced by what I was being exposed to by Occupy.
