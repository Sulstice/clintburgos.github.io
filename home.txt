Hello! My name is <b>Clinton Burgos</b>. I'm a Sophomore at the <b>University of Texas at Austin</b> studying <b>Computer Science</b>
with a minor in <b>Psychology</b>. I have also had experience with <b>Neuroscience</b> research at Tufts University, where I helped 
install and figure out how to use ERP processing software and wrote documentation for others in the lab to learn from. 
I also enjoy self-conducted media projects such as <b>music</b>, short films, video games, and written stories. This website 
has hosted my projects since 2005, undergoing several revisions over the years.

Please take a look at my <font color="white"><a href="/clintonburgosresume2015_fall_cs_web.pdf">resume.</a></font>
